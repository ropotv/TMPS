This is a Java application that is used for evaluation of student Ropot Vasile, FAF-181 Student. 
In this program I used design patterns in order to make code cleaner and easier to change later. 

This is my own program, but it is free to use.

Design patterns used:
Factory Method - DtoFactory
Builder - Constructor of Dog and Cat
Abstract Factory - IAnimal and Animal, Dog, Cat
Prototype - Clone the cat
