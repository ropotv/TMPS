This is a Java application that is used for evaluation of student Ropot Vasile, FAF-181 Student. In this program I used design patterns in order to make code cleaner and easier to change later.

This was elaborated for Laboratory 3 of TMPS Project. This is my own program, but it is free to use.

Design pattern used:
<h2> Memento </h2>
It is a simple text editor which allows you to jump back if you made a typo error.
