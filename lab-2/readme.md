This is a Java application that is used for evaluation of student Ropot Vasile, FAF-181 Student. In this program I used design patterns in order to make code cleaner and easier to change later.

This was elaborated for Laboratory 2 of TMPS Project.
This is my own program, but it is free to use.

Design patterns used: 
<ul>
<li>Adapter - WeightAdapter</li>
<li>Bridge - User Metric property (could be two types)</li>
<li>Composite - "From" and "To" methods from WeightAdapter </li>
</ul>
